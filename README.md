# What is this?

This project is built as an exploration of two main technologies:

- [Remix](https://remix.run/) - a React-based "full stack web framework"
- [LangChain (JS)](https://js.langchain.com/docs/) - a "framework for developing applications powered by language models"

More specifically, the project is built on top of Remix's [Indie Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack) though it does not make use of most of the features included in the stack.

To run locally, you need a .env file with `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `SERPAPI_API_KEY`

Note: this project should be treated as a collection of rough prototypes, it is not clean / optimal code.
